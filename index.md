# Mario Liebnberg

I am a goal-driven, hard-working individual, who enjoys to work with like-minded people in progressive and fast-paced environments. I am naturally an organised and logical person, but I have the ability to approach things from a more creative perspective, allowing me to think outside the box and give a different perspective on things. I excel in dynamic conditions where I can constantly adapt and tackle new problems. I enjoy having a broad skillset and knowledgebase, but my main interests lie in the domain of information technology.
*Degree in Business Management and Information Systems
*Experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Java, Python, SQL and Pascal.
Currently looking to collaborate on more projects on GitHub.
