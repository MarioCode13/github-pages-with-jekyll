# Information

I am a goal-driven, hard-working individual, who enjoys to work with like-minded people in progressive and fast-paced environments. I am naturally an organised and logical person, but I have the ability to approach things from a more creative perspective, allowing me to think outside the box and give a different perspective on things. I excel in dynamic conditions where I can constantly adapt and tackle new problems. I enjoy having a broad skillset and knowledgebase, but my main interests lie in the domain of information technology.
Currently living in Johannesburg, South Africa looking for job opportunities and to collaborate on more projects on GitHub.
